Metal Slug Unity is a very simplified version of Metal Slug Neo Geo made on Unity.
It's part of a school project at Universidad Complutense de Madrid in IT department specialisation Video Game development.
It allowed to learn from scratch the mechanics of a video game. How to build it, how to organize myself and so on...
